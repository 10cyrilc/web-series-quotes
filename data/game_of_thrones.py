At the Wall, a dozen lords commander came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them.  He counseled kings as well.  He could have been a king himself, but when they offered him the crown he told them they should give it to his younger brother.  How many men would do that?

We are trapped in its flow, hurtling from past to present, always in the same direction.  The lives of trees are different.  They root and grow and die in one place, and that river does not move them.  The oak is the acorn, the acorn is the oak.  And the weirwood... a thousand human years are a moment to a weirwood, and through such gates you and I may gaze into the past. ",
